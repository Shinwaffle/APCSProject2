when creating a level, make sure it's called
"Level" followed by a "_"
for example: Level_15
Whatever is at the end will just alter the order the levels come out.
Here's how you should order the levels:
there's "stages" in a sense.
Level_1_1 is stage 1 level one
Level_1_6 is stage 2 level six
and so on.
